                    Hello! My name is Candice. I am a full-time employee and student, all while trying to be a part-time hiker, rock-climber, camper, and adventurer.

                    I've always worked in lending and I enjoy it. However, many of these companies have a similar issue: their website. I've worked for national mortgage companies and servicers, local credit unions, and start-up mortgage brokers. I've seen my fair share of websites that are difficult to navigate, poorly organized, unappealing, or simply do not work properly. I was always amazed that these companies let the website remain difficult for their users to utilize. After all, your website is often times your first impression.

                    Your website should make it easy for clients to find, learn about, sign up, and use the products and services that you have to offer.
